# Introduction

Nursing homes, also known as skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) or long-term care facilities, are residential facilities that provide comprehensive healthcare and assistance to individuals who require significant support with daily activities and medical care. They primarily cater to older adults with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or those recovering from surgeries or hospital stays. Research shows that there are about 26,514 nursing homes in the US and an estimated 70% of people who reach the age of 65 will need long term care at some point in life.

# About the data

This dataset provides comprehensive information on currently active nursing homes, such as the type of ownership, number of certified beds, legal business name, and continuing care retirement community status. It also includes ratings and scores associated with quality measures, staffing levels and other factors used in the Five-Star Rating System. Data are presented as one row per nursing home to give an overview of each facility's characteristics. This dataset is a valuable resource for healthcare professionals and industry professionals who need access to detailed information on the operations of nursing homes.
